The bio text is carefully wrapped to fit the image space, and QR codes linking to the character information are generated. Additionally, text color, font, and QR code colors can be adjusted to suit different themes. The final output is saved as an image that combines the cartoonified photo, bio, and QR code on a visually appealing background, creating a unique, shareable profile image. Progress bars provide visual feedback during intensive tasks like cartoonifying the image and saving the outpu

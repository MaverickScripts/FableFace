#FABLEFACE
FableFace is an advanced Python-based tool that generates personalized cartoon-styled profile images along with dynamic character bios, customizable backgrounds, and embedded QR codes. Using OpenCV for image processing, the tool detects and crops faces from input photos, applying various cartoonification styles such as basic, pencil sketch, or oil painting. For a creative flair, FableFace offers customizable background patterns (circles, squares, or constellations) generated using PIL, with support for dynamic color schemes. Additionally, it uses the Faker library to generate random yet detailed character bios, including traits, hobbies, and quotes. The tool also integrates QR code generation, embedding bios into a scannable format. With text wrapping for readability, multi-font support, and customizable output colors, FableFace provides an engaging and professional way to create visually appealing, character-driven profiles. Perfect for creative projects, the final output is saved as an image combining all these elements into a cohesive design.
